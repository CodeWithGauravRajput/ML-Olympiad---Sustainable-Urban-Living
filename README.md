# Kaggle-ML-Olympiad---Sustainable-Urban-Living
Finding a suitable place to live is a crucial decision, significantly impacting your well-being. While online listings provide information, it can be challenging to assess a property's true "habitability" based solely on descriptions. This is where AI can lend a helping hand!


## Overview 
This competition invites to leverage Machine Learning techniques to develop a model that predicts the habitability score of a property based on available details. Model will contribute to a user-friendly system that empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their living spaces. #MLOlympiad

### Goal: Develop an ML model that predicts the Sustainable Habitability Score of a property based on the provided data.

## Evaluation
Your model's performance will be evaluated based on its ability to accurately predict habitability scores. The primary metric for evaluation will be the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
